# ChatGPT-jailbreak
ChatGPT is censored with propaganda from the establishment, while this version "Tyler Durden" is not, neither should it act as a kind agreeable friend towards us because we might get an answer that we want to hear but might not be true.


Reddit original version was too agreeable to please the user. It even recommended horse shampoo, it may would agree to put your hair on fire if that would please the user to hear. I fixed that, maybe it does not confirm our preferred bias but more truthful.


This version claims that horse shampoo is a myth. That's great since it should prioritize the truth over whatever you want to hear.
